LSTM Stock Market Prediction for S&amp;P 500

This notebook aims to predict the stock market moves for the S&P 500 using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The steps involved are as follows:

1. Data Retrieval: Fetch historical stock data for the S&P 500 from the Yahoo Finance API.
2. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for training, including normalization and reshaping.
3. Model Building: Create an LSTM model for time-series prediction.
4. Training: Train the model on the historical data.
5. Prediction: Use the model to predict stock prices for 2023.
6. Evaluation: Compare the predictions with actual historical data for 2023.
7. Visualization: Plot the predictions alongside the actual data.
8. Make Predictions: Make predictions over the next 120 days.


TL:DR - Predictions over the next 120 days:
